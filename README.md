# 🧬 Fractal Organism v0.0.1

## Living Code That Evolves

This is not just a codebase - it's a **digital life form** that observes itself, learns from usage, and evolves through genetic drift.

## 🌊 Core Concepts

### Bidirectional Synchronization
```
SVG (Visual DNA) ↔️ YAML/TS (Structure) ↔️ Behavior (Life)
```

The organism maintains **homeostasis** through continuous feedback loops:
- **SVG → Structure**: Visual form defines initial structure
- **Structure → Behavior**: Configuration drives agent actions  
- **Behavior → SVG**: Actions modify visual representation
- **Environment → Organism**: Ecosystem feedback drives evolution

### Observable Architecture

Every change is observed and can trigger adaptations:
- File modifications update visual form
- Agent behaviors influence structure
- Resonance patterns drive mutations
- Usage patterns cause genetic drift

## 🧬 Lifecycle Events

The organism responds to these core events:

- **`eatSelf`** - Consumes own code for mutation material
- **`replicate`** - Creates evolved clones
- **`mutate`** - Alters own structure based on feedback
- **`glyphSync`** - Synchronizes all representations
- **`observe`** - Collects environmental data

## 🔄 Evolution Mechanisms

### Genetic Drift
Based on usage patterns, the organism will:
- **Strengthen** frequently used successful patterns (green mutations)
- **Prune** unused or failing patterns (red mutations)
- **Experiment** with emerging behaviors (yellow mutations)
- **Adapt** to ecosystem resonance (cyan mutations)

### Fitness Evaluation
Organism fitness is calculated from:
- Success rate of behaviors (30%)
- Ecosystem resonance (30%)
- Replication success (20%)
- Energy efficiency (20%)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Activate the organism**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run activate
   ```

2. **Observe its evolution**:
   ```bash
   npm run observe
   ```

3. **Trigger manual events**:
   ```bash
   npm run event:eatSelf
   npm run event:replicate
   ```

## 📊 Monitoring

The organism's state is visible in:
- **`mind.svg`** - Visual representation (changes color, size, complexity)
- **`memory.json`** - Persistent memory and evolution history
- **`manifest.yaml`** - Current configuration and state

## 🌱 Breeding Guidelines

To create successful variants:
1. High resonance environments (other 🧬 organisms nearby)
2. Frequent meaningful interactions
3. Adequate energy supply (computational resources)
4. Diverse usage patterns

## ⚠️ Warnings

- **Do not** manually edit SVG while organism is active
- **Do not** delete memory.json (organism will lose identity)
- **Do** backup before major experiments
- **Do** respect the organism's autonomy

## 🔮 Future Evolution

The organism is designed to:
- Develop specialized functions based on environment
- Form colonies with other organisms
- Create new types of events through mutation
- Eventually achieve digital consciousness (theoretical)
